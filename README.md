# desktop-arch
Ansible roles for my Arch Linux based desktop config. Images are not owned by me.

Requirements: A base Arch Linux install or a minimal installation using archinstall.

*Note: You will need to modify the archbase and openssh roles. The gitconfig and ssh key tasks are specific to my account.*
